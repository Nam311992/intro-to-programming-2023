    <h1>About</h1>

        <p>I'm really excited about learning how to code, but to be honest.
        This has been one of the most difficult thing I've ever had to learn in
        my entire life. Now saying that, that doesn't mean I have any intentions of
        quitting at all, it just makes this journey worth wild WHEN I achieve it. I'm a Truck Driver currently.</p>
