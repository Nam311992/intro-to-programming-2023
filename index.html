About

I'm really excited about learning how to code, but to be
honest. This has been one of the most difficult thing I've ever had to learn in
my entire life. Now saying that, that doesn't mean I have any intentions of
quitting at all, it just makes this journey worth wild WHEN I achieve it. I'm a
Truck Driver currently.
